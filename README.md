# Adminibot
This version of adminibot is a very simple Electron wrapper for Twitch chat at this point in development. While it has different pieces one might need to implement commands (there's even files for every category of command), the actual implementation of all the different commands never happened unfortunately.

For a more feature-complete version of Adminibot, please check out Adminibot Classic [here](https://github.com/Senexis/Adminibot-Classic).
